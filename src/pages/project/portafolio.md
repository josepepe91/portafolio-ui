## 📝 Description
---

Welcome to my portfolio, a website that showcases a range of personal projects and shares some interesting posts about technology, development, leadership, learning and growth. This site was built using the **Astro** framework, a static site generator that provides excellent performance and flexibility for building web applications. To ensure a fast and responsive user experience, I used **Tailwind**, a popular CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-built components and styles.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. If you have any questions or are interested in working together, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
